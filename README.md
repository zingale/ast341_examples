# AST 341 Examples

Some simple notebooks and codes demonstrating stellar physics concepts for AST 341.

## Simple Stellar Model

The notebook `simple_stellar_model.ipynb` computes various properties
of a star given its mass profile.  This was part of homework #1.  You
can explore this notebook in binder with the following link:

(it may take a few minutes to start up)

## Ideal Gas

The notebook `ideal_gas.ipynb` computes the ideal gas law by
integrating the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution (in the appropriate
integral).  This was part of homework #2.  You can explore this
notebook in binder with the following link:

(it may take a few minutes to start up)


## Orbits

The notebook `orbits.ipynb` shows how to integrate the equations of
motion for Earth orbiting around the Sun using Euler's method.
